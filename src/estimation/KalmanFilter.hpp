	The Kalman Filter is also know as a Linear Quadratic Estimator. It is a type of observer or state estimator
	which is optimal in the sense that it tries to minimise a quadratic cost function. Furthermore, the Kalman
	Filter doesnâ€™t just take the sensor measurements into account but also the underlying dynamics of the system
